# 🐧 Day 4 of My Linux Journey

Today I practiced various commands related to viewing file contents, piping, and output redirection. I also made some mistakes and fixed them with the help of feedback and trial-and-error.

---

## 📘 Commands Practiced

- `cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, `tail`
- Output redirection with `>` and `>>`
- Using pipes (`|`) to connect commands
- `echo -e` with newline formatting

---

## 🧠 Key Lessons
- Quotation marks are **required** when using `\n` in `echo -e`
- Use backward slash (\), not forward slash (/), when using \n for new lines
- Piping (`|`) allows you to pass output from one command to another
- Redirecting output (`>`) creates or replaces files with command results
- Viewing file content can be done in different ways depending on the need

## ✅ Reflection

This day gave me more confidence in using Linux commands, and I learned how even tiny syntax mistakes can change everything. I’m improving steadily and learning how to debug on my own too.

## 📌 Next Steps

I’ll continue with file and directory management, permissions, and practicing advanced piping and filtering.
