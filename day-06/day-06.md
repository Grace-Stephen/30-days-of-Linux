# üìÅ Day 6: Linux Practice ‚Äì File Searching & Content Searching

Today‚Äôs focus was on using the `find`, `locate`, and `grep` commands to search for files, folders, and file content effectively. This helped strengthen understanding of how Linux handles file structures and command-line tools for discovery and inspection.

---

## üîç Summary of Tools Used

- **`find`** ‚Äì Used to search for files/folders with specific attributes (name, modification time, size, permissions, etc.).
- **`locate`** ‚Äì Used for fast file searching based on name only. Faster but may require updating the file database with `updatedb`.
- **`grep`** ‚Äì Used to search **inside** files for specific content.

> ‚úÖ *So we use `find` and `locate` when searching for files and folders. `grep` is used when searching for content in a file. `locate` is better for quick name-based searches. `find` is more flexible ‚Äî allowing filtering by date, size, permission, and even running actions like delete.  
>
> Used `grep -i` to enable case-insensitive search.  
> Used `grep -r` to search for a word in all the files and folders in a directory.*
>
> *Before I started practicing, I first installed `locate` in my WSL Ubuntu so I could use the `locate` command.*
