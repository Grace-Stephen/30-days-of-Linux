Day 12: Background Processes & Job Control in Linux
Todayâ€™s focus was on managing background processes, job control, and disowning or logging command output using &, jobs, fg, bg, nohup, and ps. I explored how to run processes in the background, monitor their status, and bring them back to the foreground when needed.

Summary of Skills Practiced
- Launched commands to run in the background with &
- Monitored jobs using jobs and ps aux | grep
- Paused and resumed jobs with Ctrl + Z, bg, and fg
- Logged command output using nohup and redirected it to a file
- Interpreted job IDs and process IDs

Investigated real-world use of background processes like ping and top

âœ… This session helped me gain confidence in multitasking within the terminal, which is crucial when managing multiple processes like service monitoring, long-running commands, or scripts in server environments.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshots of Practice
image 1: Tested what happens when I bring a sleep process to the foreground
image 2: Used ps aux | grep to locate the ping process and terminated it
image 3: Practiced pausing a foreground process (sleep) and restarting it in the background
image 4: Started a nohup ping to google.com and a top process with logging
image 5: Verified background jobs using the jobs command
image 6: Observed that the top process finished after 5 iterations and no longer appeared in jobs
image 7: Checked the output log of the top process for system stats
image 8: Brought a background job to the foreground using fg %job_number

ðŸ’¡ Key Commands & Concepts
Run a command in the background:
- sleep 1000 &

View jobs started in the current shell:
- jobs

Bring a job to the foreground:
- fg %1

Pause a running foreground process:
- (Press) Ctrl + Z

Resume a stopped job in the background:
- bg %1

Start a long-running process with logging (ignores hangup):
- nohup ping google.com > google_ping.txt &

Monitor system usage in batch mode and log:
- nohup top -b -n 5 > top_output.txt &

Check specific running processes (e.g., ping):
- ps aux | grep ping

Real-World Use Cases
- Server Health Monitoring: Use nohup ping to continuously check server reachability and log downtimes.

- Performance Logging: Use top or htop in batch mode to capture CPU/memory usage snapshots at intervals.

- Script Execution: Run backups, updates, or data migration scripts in the background to avoid blocking your terminal.

- Troubleshooting: Restart or monitor services without stopping other critical terminal tasks.
