# ðŸ“… Day 3 - Navigating Linux Directories and Using the `tree` Command
**Date**: 24/04/2025

## Summary

Today, I focused on learning how to navigate through Linux directories using both **absolute** and **relative** paths. This gave me a deeper understanding of how files and folders are structured in Linux. I also learned how to create nested directories using `mkdir -p`, and how to move through them effectively.

After that, I explored the `tree` command, which helps visualize folder hierarchies. This required some troubleshooting because the command wasnâ€™t available initially, so I had to install it after updating and upgrading my WSL environment.

Using **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) has helped me see and understand the Linux file structure better. Navigating to folders I created from the Linux side on my Windows system helped solidify my knowledge.

## What I Did

- Learned the difference between **absolute** and **relative** paths.
- Practiced navigating through **deeply nested folders** using both path types.
- Used `mkdir -p` to create nested folders easily.
- Ran `pwd` to check the current working directory.
- Understood how commands like `cd ..`, `cd ~`, and `cd ../../..` help in navigation.
- Installed and used the `tree` command to visualize directory structure.
- Solved issues with the installation by updating and upgrading the system.
- Verified the hierarchy using `tree`.

## Reflection

Learning how to navigate using absolute and relative paths is essential. It makes locating, organizing, and managing files easier and faster, especially when writing scripts or configuring systems.

Using the `tree` command gave me a visual understanding of folder structure. This skill is useful for organizing projects and understanding complex directory hierarchies.
