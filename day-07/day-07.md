# Day 7 - Linux Practice: File & Directory Permissions (Continued from Day 5)

## üìù Summary

On Day 7, I built on what I learned in Day 5 about file permissions by testing the permissions I assigned to a group.

### üîß Scenario

- I created a file `file.txt` and gave the **DevOps group** permission to read and execute it.
- A user `zion`, who is a member of the **DevOps group**, tried to access `file.txt`.
- The file was inside `ogomafolder`, which was in the home directory.
- Zion couldn‚Äôt access the file or even list the contents of the folder.

### üß† Lesson Learned

Even if a user has group permission to a file, they **cannot access the file unless they have execute permission on the directory** it's in.

### üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

1. Logged out as zion back into my admin account.
2. Confirmed `zion` was part of the `devops` group.
3. Realized directory permission was the issue.
4. Moved `ogomafolder` to `/opt` since I couldn‚Äôt safely modify permissions on the `/home` directory.
5. Set appropriate ownership and group permissions on `/opt/ogomafolder`.
6. Verified `zion` could now access `file.txt`.
7. Noticed he also had access to other files in that folder like 'mynotes' so I restricted access to that file.
8. Experimented with `sudo`, `nano`, and navigating directories to confirm file permission behavior.
